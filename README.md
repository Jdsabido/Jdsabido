Hi, I’m @Jdsabido and I am currently doing two undergraduate degrees:
- Economics (specialization in Economic Theory)
- Financial Management

A teacher recommended me to learn to code, so I imagined opening a GitHub profile would be one of the first steps. 
Over the next month I will be trying to emulate a workflow that allows me to take my school notes using latex.
